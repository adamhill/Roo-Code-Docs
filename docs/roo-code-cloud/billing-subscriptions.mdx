# Subscriptions & Billing

Roo Code Cloud offers three subscriptions: Free, Pro and Team.

You can find details for them [in the pricing page](https://roocode.com/pricing).

## How to Upgrade

1. Once logged in, go to Billing: [app.roocode.com/billing](https://app.roocode.com/billing)
2. Choose your plan and start a trial.
3. Team only: if prompted, create your organization.
4. Complete checkout process; you'll be redirected back to the app.
5. You'll be invited to create your first Cloud Agent. You can follow the process or go to the home page.
6. On the home page, [Roomote Control](/roo-code-cloud/roomote-control) unlocks immediately (look under "Connected Workspaces").
7. Team only: from here on you'll be able to invite your team members.

## Managing Your Subscription

- Select Manage Subscription to open Stripeâ€™s portal for payment methods, invoices, and billing details.
- To cancel (sorry to see you go!):
  1) Open your Billing page
  2) Click Manage Subscription
  3) Choose Cancel plan in the Stripe portal and confirm
- During a trial, cancel before it ends to avoid the first charge. After billing, features remain active until the end of your current period. You can resubscribe anytime.

## Cloud Agents & Credits

- [Cloud Agents](/roo-code-cloud/cloud-agents) are only available in paid plans.
- Cloud Agents run in Roo Code Cloud and consume credits proportional to their run time.
- Model inference uses your own provider keys (no model markups!).
- To top up credits, go to [Billing](https://app.roocode.com/billing) and add them
- Track usage and costs alongside other stats in [Analytics](/roo-code-cloud/analytics).

#### Payment Processing
- Payments are securely processed through Stripe

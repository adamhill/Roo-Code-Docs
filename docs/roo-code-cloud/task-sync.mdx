# Task Sync/Monitoring

Task Sync streams task activity from your local VS Code to Roo Code Cloud so you can monitor progress from any device — desktop, tablet, or phone. This feature is free for all users.

## What is Task Sync?

Task Sync ingests task events one-way from your local VS Code to Roo Code Cloud so you can:
- Monitor long-running tasks from your phone while away from your desk
- See near real-time updates (polled every few seconds): messages, mode changes, and status
- Check when a task completes without sitting in front of your IDE
- Review your cloud task history anytime

## Getting Started

1. Connect your IDE (see [Connect to Cloud](/roo-code-cloud/connect))
2. Open or start a task in your local Roo Code extension
3. Visit the homescreen at https://app.roocode.com to monitor in near real time

- Personal accounts: Task Sync is enabled by default and can be toggled in Settings.
- Organization accounts: Task Sync is managed by your org admins and is off by default for members unless enabled at the org level.

## Mobile Monitoring

Task Sync is optimized for mobile. Check in on progress between meetings, during a build, or while a model is running — without being stuck at your desk.

## Upgrading to Remote Control

If you also want to continue tasks remotely (approve actions, respond to prompts, start/stop tasks), enable [Roomote Control](/roo-code-cloud/roomote-control).  
Pro includes a free 14‑day trial, then $20/month — see [Billing & Subscriptions](/roo-code-cloud/billing-subscriptions).

## Limitations

- One-way monitoring only; no cloud commands are sent to your IDE
- For live updates, your IDE must be open and connected
- Internet connection required for live updates

You can review cloud task history anytime, even when your IDE is closed.

# Cloud Agents

Roo Code Cloud Agents can run entire tasks on their own in the cloud, often automatically, so you're not limited to typing instructions in your IDE. 

## What Roo Code Cloud Agents are

Hosted, headless Roo-backed agents who:
- Run tasks in cloud containers independent of your local IDE (you don't even need to use the Roo Code VS Code extension in order to use Cloud agents)
- Have focused, optimized prompts for specific needs
- Stream task history in the [web app](https://app.roocode.com)
- Fit into your broader workflow, outside of the editor

## Agents Types

Cloud Agents come in different types optimized for specific workflows. Each uses your chosen model and API key, running in the cloud so work continues without your IDE.

### **PR Rooviewer**
  
Automatically reviews GitHub pull requests using your model, posts feedback, and tracks costs—triggered by webhooks or run on demand.

### Coming soon

We have more agents in the works, such as:
- PR Fixer
- String Translator
- Security Auditor
- Generalist

## How billing works

- Cloud Agents require an active paid plan.
- Cloud runtime is billed in credits per agent‑hour (we charge you while the agents are working, that's it)
- Model inference is billed by your provider (bring your own API keys). We don't mark inference costs up and are provider-agnostic
- You can track usage and credits in [Analytics](/roo-code-cloud/analytics); switch the metric to credits.

## Getting started

1. [Sign up](https://app.roocode.com/sign-up) for a Roo Code Cloud account
2. Upgrade to a paid plan.
3. You'll get free credits to get started
4. [Create your first agent](https://app.roocode.com/cloud-agents/create).


## FAQ

- Can I run multiple agents?
  - Yes. Each agent incurs its own runtime credit usage while running.

- Do I need to use a specific model?
  - No. We recommend a few models we've tested and found to work well, but you're free to use absolutely any model your provider offers.

- Where do I see costs?
  - Track runtime credits and usage in [Analytics](/roo-code-cloud/analytics); see [Billing & Subscriptions](/roo-code-cloud/billing-subscriptions) for plans and credits.

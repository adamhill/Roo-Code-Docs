# Slack Integration

:::

Start and manage Roo Code Cloud tasks from Slack using app mentions (@roomote) or direct messages, then track progress with live updates—all without leaving your conversation.

## What is Slack Integration

Slack Integration connects your organization's Slack workspace to Roo Code Cloud, letting you start Cloud tasks by mentioning the app or sending it a direct message.

#### Key capabilities

- **Start Cloud jobs** — Mention @roomote in channels/threads or DM the app
- **Configure inline** — Pick mode, model, and workspace without leaving Slack
- **Live progress** — TODO lists update in-place; get start links, completion summaries, and status
- **Image support** — Attach images (under 10MB each) for visual context
- **Cancel anytime** — Stop tasks with a button in the thread

#### Team-only

Requires an active organization plan. Personal accounts can't start Cloud tasks from Slack.

## Getting started

#### Step 1: Install the Slack app (org admin)

Your organization admin installs the Roo Code Slack app through your organization settings.

#### Step 2: Connect your Slack account

First-time users see a "Connect Account" button after mentioning the app. Click it to link your Slack user to your Roo account. Once linked, the configuration UI appears automatically.

#### Step 3: Mention the app or DM it

- **In channels/threads:** Type `@roomote` followed by your request
- **In DMs:** Send a regular message (no mention needed)

Generic channel messages without an explicit mention are ignored to prevent accidental triggers.

## Configuration options

#### Mode

Switches the agent's behavior (defaults from org config). Available modes depend on your organization's setup.

#### Model

Shown when using OpenRouter. Select from available models.

#### Workspace

Choose a specific repository or "All Repositories" for workspace-wide context. Your last choice is remembered.

## Limitations

- **Team plans only** — Personal accounts can't start Cloud tasks from Slack
- **Mention required in channels** — Generic channel messages without @roomote are ignored
- **Images only** — Non-image files aren't processed; images must be under 10MB
- **Active subscription** — Requires funded Cloud credits

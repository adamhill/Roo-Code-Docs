# Roomote Control

Roomote Control lets you remotely control tasks running in your local VS Code instance from the Roo Code Cloud web interface.

## What is Roomote Control?

Roomote Control creates a bidirectional connection between your local VS Code extension and Roo Code Cloud so you can:

- **Control tasks remotely** — start, stop, interact, and use the full chat interface
- Included with **Roo Code Cloud Pro**. See [Billing & Subscriptions](/roo-code-cloud/billing-subscriptions#pro-plan-20month).

## Key Features

### Real-time Workspace Connection

- Shows your connected workspaces and live status


### Remote Task Control

- **Chat interface** — Similar to IDE chat for core interactions; some settings and customizations aren't available in the browser
- **Start New Tasks** - Launch tasks in any connected workspace
- **Stop Running Tasks** - Safely terminate active tasks
- **Task Switching** - Navigate between tasks including resuming tasks that have been stopped or closed

:::note Pro Feature Required for Remote Control
While basic monitoring is available to all users, remote control capabilities (starting, stopping, and interacting with tasks remotely) require a [Pro subscription (free 14-day trial, then $20/month)](/roo-code-cloud/billing-subscriptions#pro-plan-20month).

**Option 2: From the Roo Code Plugin**
1. Click the **cloud icon** <Codicon name="cloud" /> in the top right corner of Roo Code
2. Toggle the **Roomote Control** switch in the Cloud panel

#### Step 3: Start a Remote Task

- To stop notifications on a device, toggle Off there or use OS/browser notification settings for Roo Code.

#### What to expect
- A permission prompt the first time you enable notifications.
- Alerts for task updates and completions.
- Clicking a notification opens Roo Code, usually to the relevant task.

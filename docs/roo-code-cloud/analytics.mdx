# Analytics

Analytics lets you track tokens, tasks, inference cost, and Cloud Agent credits usage in aggregate or according to a range of filters, defined by you. It's all free.

## Access

- Just go to the [Analytics](https://app.roocode.com/usage) tab

## What's tracked

- For Cloud Agents, all tasks are tracked and considered for analytics
- For the extension, only tasks you run while logged in get reported for analytics. You can turn off [task sync](/roo-code-cloud/task-sync) so the contents of tasks aren't sent to Cloud, but usage numbers are always reported while you're logged into the extension. That allows you to keep certain tasks away from Cloud while still benefiting from usage analytics.

## QOL Improvements

* Keyboard shortcut update: “Add to Context” moved to Ctrl+K Ctrl+A (Windows/Linux) / Cmd+K Cmd+A (macOS) to avoid Redo conflict and restore standard Redo (thanks swythan!) ([#8653](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8653))

## Bug Fixes

* Clean up max output token calculations to prevent context window overruns (thanks enerage!) ([#8822](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8822))
* Fix provider model loading race conditions to reduce timeouts and intermittent errors ([#8836](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8836))

## Provider Updates

* OpenAI-compatible: centralized ~20% maxTokens cap to prevent context overruns; GLM‑4.6‑turbo default 40,960 for reliable long-context runs (thanks enerage!) ([#8822](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8822))

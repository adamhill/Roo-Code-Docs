## Task Sync & Roomote Control

Introducing our new cloud connectivity features that let you **monitor and control long-running tasks from your phone** - no more waiting at your desk! ([#7799](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7799), [#7805](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7805), [#7850](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7850)):

> **Important**: Roo Code remains **completely free and open source**. Task Sync and Roomote Control are optional supplementary services that connect your local VS Code to the cloud - all processing still happens in your VS Code instance.

- **Cloud Visibility**: View your VS Code tasks from any browser

**[Roomote Control](/roo-code-cloud/roomote-control) ([14-Day Free Trial, then $20/month](/roo-code-cloud/billing-subscriptions#pro-plan-20month))**:
- **Continue Tasks Remotely**: Keep tasks going from your phone - respond to prompts, fix errors, approve actions
- **Full Chat Control**: Interact with the chatbox as though you were in your IDE
- **Start/Stop Tasks**: Launch new tasks or terminate running ones from anywhere
- **Complete Control**: Full bidirectional control of your local VS Code from anywhere

Task Sync enables monitoring your local development environment from any device. Add Roomote Control for full remote control capabilities - whether you're on another computer, tablet, or smartphone.

> **Documentation**: See [Task Sync](/roo-code-cloud/task-sync), [Roomote Control Guide](/roo-code-cloud/roomote-control), and [Billing & Subscriptions](/roo-code-cloud/billing-subscriptions).

## GPT-5-Codex lands in OpenAI Native

- **Work with repository-scale context**: Keep multi-file specs and long reviews in a single thread thanks to a 400k token window.
- **Reuse prompts faster and include visuals**: Prompt caching and image support help you iterate on UI fixes without re-uploading context.
- **Let the model adapt its effort**: GPT-5-Codex automatically balances quick responses for simple questions with deeper reasoning on complex builds.

This gives teams a higher-capacity OpenAI option without extra configuration.[#8260](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8260):

> **Documentation**: See [OpenAI Provider Guide](/providers/openai) for capabilities and setup guidance.

## QOL Improvements

* **Auto-approve keyboard shortcut**: Toggle approvals with Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+A from anywhere in the editor so you can stay in the flow while reviewing changes (via [#8214](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8214))
* **Click-to-Edit Chat Messages**: Click directly on any message text to edit it, with ESC to cancel and improved padding consistency ([#7790](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7790))
* **Enhanced Reasoning Display**: The AI's thinking process now shows a persistent timer and displays reasoning content in clean italic text ([#7752](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7752))
* **Easier-to-scan reasoning transcripts**: Added clear line breaks before reasoning headers inside the UI so long thoughts are easier to skim (via [#7868](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7868))
* **Manual Auth URL Input**: Users in containerized environments can now paste authentication redirect URLs manually when automatic redirection fails ([#7805](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7805))
* **Active Mode Centering**: The mode selector dropdown now automatically centers the active mode when opened ([#7883](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7883))
* **Preserve First Message**: The first message containing slash commands or initial context is now preserved during conversation condensing instead of being replaced with a summary ([#7910](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7910))
* **Checkpoint Initialization Notifications**: You'll now receive clear notifications when checkpoint initialization fails, particularly with nested Git repositories ([#7766](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7766))
* **Translation coverage auditing**: The translation checker now validates package.nls locales by default to catch missing strings before release (via [#8255](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8255))

* Smaller and more subtle auto-approve UI (thanks brunobergher!) ([#7894](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7894))
* Disable Roomote Control on logout for better security ([#7976](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7976))
* Add padding to the cloudview for better visual spacing ([#7954](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7954))

* Temporarily pause auto-approve with a global “Enabled” switch so you can pause without losing your per-toggle selections; the UI clearly distinguishes global vs. per-toggle states ([#8024](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8024))
* Slash commands management moved to Settings > Slash Commands with a gear shortcut from the chat popover; the popover is now selection-only for quick use ([#7988](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7988))
* Keyboard shortcut to quickly “Add to Context” (macOS: Cmd+Y; Windows/Linux: Ctrl+Y) ([#7908](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7908))
* Add Image button moved inside the text area (top-right) and Enhance Prompt positioned above Send to reduce pointer travel and clarify layout ([#7989](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7989))
* Composer action buttons now appear only when there's text input, reducing visual clutter and accidental clicks ([#7987](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7987))
* New Task button icon switched from "+" to a compose/pencil icon to better match its purpose and align with codicon standards ([#7942](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7942))
* **Redesigned Message Feed**: Enjoy a cleaner, more readable chat interface with improved visual hierarchy that helps you focus on what matters ([#7985](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7985))
* **Responsive Auto-Approve**: The auto-approve dropdown now adapts to different window sizes with smart 1-2 column layouts, and tooltips show all enabled actions without truncation ([#8032](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8032))
* **Network Resilience**: Telemetry data now automatically retries on network failures, ensuring analytics and diagnostics aren't lost during connectivity issues ([#7597](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7597))
* **Code blocks wrap by default**: Code blocks now wrap text by default, and the snippet toolbar no longer includes language or wrap toggles, keeping snippets readable across locales (via [#8194](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8194); [#8208](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8208))

## Bug Fixes

* **Roo provider stays signed in**: Roo provider tokens refresh automatically and the local evals app binds to port 3446 for predictable scripts (via [#8224](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8224))
* **Checkpoint text stays on one line**: Prevented multi-line wrapping in languages such as Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Russian so the checkpoint UI stays compact (via [#8207](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8207); reported in [#8206](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues/8206))
* **Ollama respects Modelfile num_ctx**: Roo now defers to your Modelfile’s context window to avoid GPU OOMs while still allowing explicit overrides when needed (via [#7798](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7798); reported in [#7797](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues/7797))
* **Groq Context Window**: Fixed incorrect display of cached tokens in context window ([#7839](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7839))

* Fix message queue re-queue loop in Task.ask() that could degrade performance ([#7823](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7823))
* Restrict @-mention parsing to line-start or whitespace boundaries to prevent false triggers ([#7876](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7876))
* Make nested git repository warning persistent with path info for better visibility ([#7885](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7885))
* Include API key in Ollama /api/tags requests to support authenticated instances (thanks ItsOnlyBinary!) ([#7903](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7903))
* Preserve original first message context during conversation condensing for more coherent long chats ([#7939](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7939))

* **Ollama Model Info**: Fixed max context window display for Ollama models (thanks ItsOnlyBinary!) ([#7679](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7679))
* **Image Preview Caching**: This ensures the chat always displays the newly generated image instead of a cached version ([#7860](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7860))

* Restore square brackets in Gemini-generated code so arrays/indexers render correctly (e.g., `string[] items = new string[5];`) (thanks AtkinsDynamicObjects!) ([#7577](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7577))
* Filter out Claude Code built-in tools (ExitPlanMode, BashOutput, KillBash) to avoid erroneous tool calls and distracting warnings (thanks juliettefournier-econ!) ([#7818](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7818))

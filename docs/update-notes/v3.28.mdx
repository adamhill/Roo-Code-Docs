- **FREE ACCESS**: No API keys, no costs - completely free through Roo Code Cloud
- **Advanced Capabilities**: Powerful AI model with **image support** for multimodal coding tasks
- **Not So Massive Context**: 200,000 token context window with 16,384 max output
- **Stealth Performance**: Experience cutting-edge model performance with the code-supernova variant
- **Zero Setup**: Just select it from your Roo Code Cloud provider - no configuration needed

Select the **FREE** code-supernova model from the Roo provider to start using this powerful new capability at **no cost**.

> **Documentation**: See the [Roo Code Cloud provider guide](/providers/roo-code-cloud) for model selection details.

## Task Sync & Roomote Control

Introducing our new cloud connectivity features that let you **monitor and control long-running tasks from your phone** - no more waiting at your desk! ([#7799](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7799), [#7805](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7805), [#7850](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7850)):

> **Important**: Roo Code remains **completely free and open source**. Task Sync and Roomote Control are optional supplementary services that connect your local VS Code to the cloud - all processing still happens in your VS Code instance.

**[Task Sync](/roo-code-cloud/task-sync) (FREE for All Users)**:
- **Monitor from Anywhere**: Check on long-running tasks from your phone while away from your desk
- **Real-time Updates**: Live streaming of your local task messages and progress
- **Task History**: Your tasks are saved to the cloud for later reference
- **Cloud Visibility**: View your VS Code tasks from any browser

**[Roomote Control](/roo-code-cloud/roomote-control) ([14-Day Free Trial, then $20/month](/roo-code-cloud/billing-subscriptions))**:
- **Continue Tasks Remotely**: Keep tasks going from your phone - respond to prompts, fix errors, approve actions
- **Full Chat Control**: Interact with the chatbox as though you were in your IDE
- **Start/Stop Tasks**: Launch new tasks or terminate running ones from anywhere
- **Complete Control**: Full bidirectional control of your local VS Code from anywhere

Task Sync enables monitoring your local development environment from any device. Add Roomote Control for full remote control capabilities - whether you're on another computer, tablet, or smartphone.

> **Documentation**: See [Task Sync](/roo-code-cloud/task-sync), [Roomote Control Guide](/roo-code-cloud/roomote-control), and [Billing & Subscriptions](/roo-code-cloud/billing-subscriptions).

## GPT-5-Codex lands in OpenAI Native

- **Work with repository-scale context**: Keep multi-file specs and long reviews in a single thread thanks to a 400k token window.
- **Reuse prompts faster and include visuals**: Prompt caching and image support help you iterate on UI fixes without re-uploading context.
- **Let the model adapt its effort**: GPT-5-Codex automatically balances quick responses for simple questions with deeper reasoning on complex builds.

This gives teams a higher-capacity OpenAI option without extra configuration.[#8260](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8260):

> **Documentation**: See [OpenAI Provider Guide](/providers/openai) for capabilities and setup guidance.

* **Code blocks wrap by default**: Code blocks now wrap text by default, and the snippet toolbar no longer includes language or wrap toggles, keeping snippets readable across locales (via [#8194](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8194); [#8208](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8208))

* **Reset logs you out of Roo Code Cloud**: Reset now also logs you out of Roo Code Cloud for a truly clean slate; the reset still completes even if logout fails. ([#8312](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8312))
* **Measure engagement with upsell messages**: Telemetry for DismissibleUpsell tracks dismiss vs click (upsellId only) to tune messaging and reduce noise; no user-facing behavior change. ([#8309](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8309))

* Include reasoning messages in cloud task histories so you can review complete thinking after runs ([#8401](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8401))

* Identify Cloud tasks in the extension bridge to improve diagnostics, logging, and future UI behavior ([#8539](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8539))
* Add the parent task ID in telemetry to improve traceability ([#8532](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8532))

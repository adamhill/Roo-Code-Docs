## Provider Updates

### GLM‑4.6 on Z.ai

We’ve added the GLM‑4.6 model to the Z.ai provider (thanks dmarkey!) ([#8408](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8408)). What you get:

- 200k (204,800) token context window for longer files and multi‑turn conversations
- Better real‑world coding performance, including cleaner front‑end output
- Improved reasoning with tool‑use support for steadier multi‑step tasks
- Stronger agent behavior for search/tool workflows

To use it, select GLM‑4.6 under the Z.ai provider in Settings.

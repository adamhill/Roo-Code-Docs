# Roo Code 3.18 Release Notes (2025-05-21)

This release introduces advanced AI models with enhanced reasoning capabilities, comprehensive context condensing improvements, YAML support for custom modes, streamlined development infrastructure, and numerous quality-of-life improvements and bug fixes.

## Codebase Indexing (Experimental)
Our new **experimental** [Codebase Indexing](/features/codebase-indexing) feature enables semantic search across your entire project using AI embeddings. Remember, this is **disabled by default** and requires additional setup (enable in Settings (⚙️) > "Experimental").

<img src="/img/codebase-indexing/codebase-indexing.png" alt="Codebase Indexing Settings" width="600" />

Key capabilities:
*   **Semantic Code Search**: Find relevant code using natural language queries instead of exact keyword matches
*   **AI-Powered Understanding**: The new [`codebase_search`](/advanced-usage/available-tools/codebase-search) tool understands code meaning and relationships
*   **Cross-Project Discovery**: Search your entire indexed codebase, not just open files
*   **Flexible Setup**: Choose between OpenAI embeddings or local Ollama processing
*   **Vector-Powered Search**: Advanced embedding technology with Qdrant vector database storage
*   **Enhanced Settings**: Improved configuration saving and Ollama indexing performance (thanks daniel-lxs!)

Transform how you navigate large codebases - ask "find authentication logic" and get meaningful results instead of hunting through files.

For setup instructions and detailed usage, see the main [Codebase Indexing documentation](/features/codebase-indexing).

## Context Condensing Upgrades
Our Intelligent Context Condensing feature sees significant enhancements for better control and clarity. **Note**: As of version 3.19.0, this feature is enabled by default.

Watch a quick overview:
<div style={{width: '50%', margin: 'auto'}}>
  <div style={{position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '177.77%', height: 0, overflow: 'hidden'}}>
    <iframe
      src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o5xgO9N8vVU"
      title="YouTube Short"
      frameBorder="0"
      allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
      allowFullScreen
      style={{position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%'}}
    ></iframe>
  </div>
</div>
Key updates:
*   **Adjustable Condensing Threshold & Manual Control**: Fine-tune automatic condensing or trigger it manually. [Learn more](/features/intelligent-context-condensing#controlling-context-condensing).
*   **Advanced Controls & UI Enhancements**: New settings for fine-tuning conversation compression behavior with improved interface components for managing condensing settings. (thanks SannidhyaSah!)
*   **Clear UI Indicators**: Better visual feedback during condensing. [Details](/features/intelligent-context-condensing#understanding-context-condensing-activity).
*   **Improved Compression**: Better conversation summarization while preserving important context during compression. (thanks SannidhyaSah!)
*   **Accurate Token Counting**: Improved accuracy for context and cost calculations. [More info](/features/intelligent-context-condensing#token-counting).

For full details, see the main [Intelligent Context Condensing documentation](/features/intelligent-context-condensing).

## Custom Modes: YAML Support

Custom mode configuration is now significantly improved with **YAML support** for both global and project-level (`.roomodes`) definitions. YAML is the new default, offering superior readability with cleaner syntax, support for comments (`#`), and easier multi-line string management. While JSON remains supported for backward compatibility, YAML streamlines mode creation, sharing, and version control.

For comprehensive details on YAML benefits, syntax, and migrating existing JSON configurations, please see our updated [Custom Modes documentation](/features/custom-modes#migration-to-yaml-format). (thanks R-omk! Additional thanks to GreatScottyMac for the YAML inspiration!)

## API Cost Control: Request Limits
To enhance API cost management, you can now set a **Max Requests** limit for auto-approved actions. This prevents Roo Code from making an excessive number of consecutive API calls without your re-approval.

*Notification when the auto-approved request limit is met.*

Learn more about configuring this safeguard in our [Rate Limits and Costs documentation](/advanced-usage/rate-limits-costs#limiting-auto-approved-requests). (Inspired by Cline, thanks hassoncs!)

# Roo Code 3.28.0 Release Notes (2025-09-10)

This release introduces Task Sync & Roomote Control - check on long-running tasks from your phone and keep them going without being stuck at your desk. Plus enhanced chat editing and multiple bug fixes.

## Task Sync & Roomote Control

Introducing our new cloud connectivity features that let you **monitor and control long-running tasks from your phone** - no more waiting at your desk! ([#7799](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7799), [#7805](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7805), [#7850](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7850)):

> **Important**: Roo Code remains **completely free and open source**. Task Sync and Roomote Control are optional supplementary services that connect your local VS Code to the cloud - all processing still happens in your VS Code instance.

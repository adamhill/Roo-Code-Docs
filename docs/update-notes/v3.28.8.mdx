## Fixed: GPT-5-Codex errors and more!

We've resolved the situation where LLMs would sometimes not make tool calls in their response which improves Roo's overall flow. ([#8292](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8292))

- **GPT-5-Codex Response Fix**: Fixes the issue where the model `gpt-5-codex` (and less frequently other models) would send a response with no assistant message
- **Completion Tool Reliability**: This fix eliminates some situations where the LLM would repeat its last text message when the attempt_completion tool was called
- **Tool Call Consistency**: Fixes where the LLM would sometimes respond without a tool call

## QOL Improvements

* **Cloud Account Management**: Added account switcher and "Create Team Account" option for logged-in users, making it easier to manage multiple accounts ([#8291](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8291))
* **Social Media Sharing**: Improved OpenGraph images for better preview cards when sharing Roo Code links on Slack, Twitter, and Facebook ([#8285](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8285))

## Bug Fixes

* **Context Condensing**: Fixed an issue where the initial task request was being lost during context condensing, causing Roo to try to re-answer the original task ask when resuming after condensing ([#8298](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8298))

## Provider Updates

* **New Free Models**: Added two more free models to the Roo provider ([#8304](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8304)):
  - xai/grok-4-fast
  - deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1

## Misc Improvements

* **Infrastructure**: Set port 3446 for web-evals service in production mode ([#8288](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8288))

# Roo Code 3.29.3 Release Notes (2025-10-28)

This patch adds reasoning controls for Roo and Z.ai providers, updates Gemini "latest" models, and delivers stability and UI fixes.

## QOL Improvements

* Toggle time and cost display in the system prompt to reduce model distraction during long runs (thanks jaxnb!) ([#8451](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8451))
* After “Add to Context,” input auto‑focuses and two newlines are inserted for clearer separation, so you can keep typing immediately ([#8877](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8877))

## Bug Fixes

* LiteLLM: Prefer max_output_tokens (with fallback to max_tokens) to prevent 400 errors on Claude Sonnet 4.5 via Vertex (thanks fabb!) ([#8455](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8455))
* Messages typed during context condensing now send automatically once condensing finishes; per‑task queues no longer cross‑drain (thanks JosXa!) ([#8478](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8478))
* Rate limiting now uses a monotonic clock and enforces a hard cap at the configured limit to avoid long lockouts (thanks chrarnoldus, intermarkec!) ([#8456](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8456))
* Restore green tests and TypeScript build for LiteLLM after interface changes; keeps monotonic clock fix and token limit behavior ([#8870](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8870))
* Checkpoint menu popover no longer clips long option text; items remain fully visible ([#8867](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8867))

## Provider Updates

* Roo provider: Reasoning effort control lets you choose deeper step‑by‑step thinking vs. faster/cheaper responses. See [Roo Code Cloud provider](/providers/roo-code-cloud) for details. ([#8874](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8874))
* Z.ai (GLM‑4.5/4.6): “Enable reasoning” toggle to activate Deep Thinking; hidden on unsupported models (thanks BeWater799!). See [Z.ai provider](/providers/zai). ([#8872](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8872))
* Gemini: Updated model list and “latest” aliases for easier selection (thanks cleacos!). See [Gemini provider](/providers/gemini). ([#8486](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8486))

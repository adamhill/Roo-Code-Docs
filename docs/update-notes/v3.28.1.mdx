## QOL Improvements

* **Active Mode Centering**: The mode selector dropdown now automatically centers the active mode when opened ([#7883](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7883))
* **Preserve First Message**: The first message containing slash commands or initial context is now preserved during conversation condensing instead of being replaced with a summary ([#7910](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7910))
* **Checkpoint Initialization Notifications**: You'll now receive clear notifications when checkpoint initialization fails, particularly with nested Git repositories ([#7766](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7766))

## Bug Fixes

* **Image Preview Caching**: This ensures the chat always displays the newly generated image instead of a cached version ([#7860](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7860))

## Misc Improvements

* **Cloud Task Button**: Added a new button for opening tasks in Roo Code Cloud with QR codes and shareable URLs ([#7572](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7572))
* **Telemetry Default**: Posthog telemetry is now enabled by default with easy opt-out options in settings ([#7909](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7909))
* **Roo Code Cloud Announcement**: Updated in-app announcements about Roo Code Cloud features, localized in 18 languages ([#7914](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7914))

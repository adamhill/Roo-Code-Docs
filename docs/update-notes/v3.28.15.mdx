## QOL Improvements

* Include reasoning messages in cloud task histories so you can review complete thinking after runs ([#8401](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8401))
* Add structured data to the homepage to improve SEO and discoverability ([#8427](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8427))

## Bug Fixes

* “Reset and Continue” now truly resets cost tracking; subsequent requests only count new costs (thanks alecoot!) ([#6890](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6890))
* Prompts settings: Save button activates on first change and preserves empty strings (thanks beccare!) ([#8267](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8267))
* Remove overeager “unsaved changes” dialog in Settings when nothing changed ([#8410](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8410))
* Show the Send button when only images are attached ([#8423](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8423))

## Provider Updates

* Chutes: Add new models for speed, longer context, and multimodal reasoning (DeepSeek V3.1 Terminus, V3.1 turbo, V3.2-Exp; GLM‑4.6‑FP8; Qwen3‑VL‑235B‑A22B‑Thinking) (thanks mohammad154!) ([#8467](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8467))
* Gemini: Remove unsupported free “2.5 Flash Image Preview”; paid path unaffected (thanks SannidhyaSah!) ([#8359](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8359))
* Bedrock: Treat Claude Sonnet 4 as 1M context to reduce truncation and mis-selection ([#8421](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8421))
* Roo Code Cloud: Deprecate “Grok 4 Fast”; show warning if selected and hide when not selected ([#8481](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8481))

## Misc Improvements

* Add internal UsageStats schema and type to enable future dashboards and clearer usage insights ([#8441](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8441))
* Security: Update Vite dev server to 6.3.6 to address path traversal (GHSA-g4jq-h2w9-997c) (thanks app/renovate!) ([#7838](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7838))
* Dependency: Update glob to 11.0.3 for stability (thanks app/renovate!) ([#7767](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7767))

## GPT-5-Codex lands in OpenAI Native

- **Work with repository-scale context**: Keep multi-file specs and long reviews in a single thread thanks to a 400k token window.
- **Reuse prompts faster and include visuals**: Prompt caching and image support help you iterate on UI fixes without re-uploading context.
- **Let the model adapt its effort**: GPT-5-Codex automatically balances quick responses for simple questions with deeper reasoning on complex builds.

This gives teams a higher-capacity OpenAI option without extra configuration.[#8260](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8260):

## QOL Improvements

* **Keyboard shortcut for auto-approve**: Toggle approvals with Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+A from anywhere in the editor, keeping focus on the code review flow (via [#8214](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8214))
* **Cleaner code blocks**: Removed the snippet language picker and word-wrap toggle so wrapped code is easier to read and copy across locales (via [#8208](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8208))
* **More readable reasoning blocks**: Added spacing before section headers inside reasoning transcripts to make long explanations easier to scan (via [#7868](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7868))
* **Translation checks cover package settings**: The missing translation finder now validates package.nls files for 17 locales to catch untranslated VS Code strings earlier (via [#8255](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8255))

## Bug Fixes

* **Bare-metal evals stay signed in**: Roo provider tokens refresh automatically and the local evals app binds to port 3446 for predictable scripts (via [#8224](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8224))
* **Checkpoint text stays on one line**: Prevented multi-line wrapping in languages such as Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Russian so the checkpoint UI stays compact (via [#8207](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8207); reported in [#8206](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues/8206))
* **Ollama respects Modelfile num_ctx**: Roo now defers to your Modelfileâ€™s context window to avoid GPU OOMs while still allowing explicit overrides when needed (via [#7798](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7798); reported in [#7797](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues/7797))

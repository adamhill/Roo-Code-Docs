# Roo Code 3.23 Release Notes

This release graduates codebase indexing to a stable feature, introduces a powerful new todo list for managing complex tasks, and adds several new orchestrator modes to automate your workflow.

## Codebase Indexing: Always On, Always Ready

Codebase indexing has graduated from an experimental feature and is now a core part of Roo Code, available directly from your chat input. You can now manage your index by clicking the database icon in the bottom-right corner of the chat box. Once configured, the indexer runs automatically in the background, ensuring Roo always has an up-to-date semantic understanding of your project. To get started, see the [Codebase Indexing quick start guide](/features/codebase-indexing#quick-start-guide).

Thank you to MuriloFP, OleynikAleksandr, sxueck, CW-B-W, WAcry, and bughaver for helping get this across the finish line! ([#5378](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5378), [#5377](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5377), [#5383](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5383), [#5483](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5483))

## New: Task Todo List

This release introduces a new todo list feature to help you keep track of complex tasks. Roo Code will now display a checklist of steps for your task, ensuring that no step is missed. You can view and manage the todo list directly in the chat interface.

- **Automated Task Breakdown**: The Architect mode now defaults to creating a structured `update_todo_list` instead of a markdown plan, making its output more actionable and consistent (thanks mrubens, hannesrudolph!) ([#5472](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5472))
- **Task Management Hint**: Roo Code now provides a hint to use the `update_todo_list` tool for complicated tasks when the todo list is empty (thanks mrubens!) ([#5473](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5473))
- **Auto-Approval Setting**: Added a new setting `alwaysAllowUpdateTodoList` to give users more granular control over which actions can be auto-approved (thanks mrubens!) ([#5482](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5482))

## New: Message Editing

You can now edit sent messages, giving you more flexibility and control over your conversation history.

- **Edit and Replace**: All edits now replace the selected message and all subsequent messages, making the feature more straightforward to use (thanks liwilliam2021!) ([#5488](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5488), [#5359](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5359))
- **Edit Halting**: Prevents users from attempting to edit a message while a response is streaming (thanks mrubens!) ([#5494](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5494))

## Orchestrator Mode Improvements

We've added and improved several orchestrator modes to streamline complex workflows.

- **Issue Fixer Orchestrator**: Introduces a new mode that automates the entire workflow for resolving GitHub issues, from analysis to PR creation (thanks MuriloFP!) ([#5379](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5379), [#5366](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5366))
- **PR Fixer Orchestrator**: Adds a user approval checkpoint before committing changes, handles large diffs by summarizing them, and uses targeted file staging (thanks MuriloFP!) ([#5407](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5407))
- **PR Reviewer Orchestrator**: Now delegates specialized analysis to other modes for more comprehensive code reviews (thanks MuriloFP!) ([#5406](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5406))

## QOL Improvements

- **Configurable Search Results**: You can now configure the maximum number of codebase search results (from 10 to 1000) in the experimental settings (thanks MuriloFP, SannidhyaSah, seedlord!) ([#5402](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5402))
- **Simplified Prompt History**: Navigate your prompt history using only the up and down arrow keys when the cursor is at the start of the input field (thanks mrubens!) ([#5467](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5467))
- **API Provider Search**: You can now search and filter the list of API providers in the settings (thanks GOODBOY008!) ([#5278](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5278))
- **Copy Prompt Button**: Adds a 'Copy Prompt' button to the task actions (thanks Juice10!) ([#5392](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5392))
- **Chat UI**: Fixes several UI inconsistencies and layout shifting issues in the chat view to create a more stable and polished user experience (thanks seedlord!) ([#5237](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5237))
- **Clean Custom Mode Deletion**: Deleting a custom mode now also deletes its corresponding `.roo/rules-{mode}` folder (thanks hannesrudolph!) ([#5317](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5317))

## Bug Fixes

- **`apply_diff` Tool**: Fixed an issue where the `apply_diff` tool would hang indefinitely on an error ([#5391](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5391))
- **Chat Focus**: Prevents the chat from losing focus during automated workflows, stopping user input from being accidentally redirected to files being edited by Roo (thanks hannesrudolph, ColbySerpa!) ([#5349](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5349))
- **Architect Mode File Restrictions**: Fixed an issue where Architect mode was not properly enforcing file restrictions (thanks roomote-bot, shanemmattner!) ([#5447](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5447))
- **Slash Command Descriptions**: Standardizes mode descriptions in slash commands for a more consistent user experience (thanks mrubens!) ([#5388](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5388))
- **`insert_content` Tool**: The `insert_content` tool can now create new files when inserting content at the beginning or end of a file (thanks Ruakij, KJ7LNW!) ([#4382](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4382))
- **Follow-up Question Timer**: Fixed an issue where the auto-approval timer for follow-up questions would continue even after a user responded (thanks liwilliam2021!) ([#5368](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5368))
- **TypeScript Watch Path**: Fixes an issue where TypeScript compiler errors in watch mode would not correctly link back to the source file (thanks bbenshalom, KJ7LNW!) ([#5155](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5155))
- **Code Indexing Silent Failures**: Prevents silent failures in code indexing when using incompatible or misconfigured OpenAI-compatible endpoints by providing clear error messages (thanks hannesrudolph, sfz009900!) ([#5352](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5352))

## Provider Updates

- **OpenRouter**: Fixes an issue where the number of reserved tokens for OpenRouter models was displayed incorrectly (thanks shariqriazz!) ([#5240](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5240))

# Roo Code 3.19.0 Release Notes (2025-05-30)

This release focuses on streamlining the user interface with intelligent context condensing enabled by default, improved mode organization, enhanced file protection, and numerous quality-of-life improvements.

---

## Intelligent Context Condensing Now Default
We've enabled intelligent context condensing by default and relocated the condense button for easier access:

- **Default Activation**: Intelligent context condensing is now enabled out of the box for all users
- **Improved Button Placement**: Moved the condense button out of the expanded task menu for quicker access
- **Smart Error Handling**: The system now skips condensing and shows clear error messages if context grows during the condensing process

*Intelligent Context Condensing configuration options: automatic triggering toggle, threshold slider, API configuration selection, and custom prompt customization.*

## Streamlined Mode Organization
We've reorganized the interface for better workflow organization:

- **Modes Tab**: Transformed the Prompts tab into a dedicated Modes tab for clearer navigation
- **Settings Relocation**: Moved support prompts to Settings for better organization
- **Cleaner Interface**: Simplified the main interface by grouping related features more logically

Navigate between different modes and prompts more intuitively.

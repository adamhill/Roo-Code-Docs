## New run_slash_command Tool

We've added a powerful new tool that allows the AI to execute slash commands as part of its workflow ([#7473](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7473)):

- **Automated Command Execution**: The AI can now run commands like `/init`, `/review`, and other slash commands automatically
- **Seamless Integration**: Existing slash commands work directly within AI workflows without manual intervention
- **Enhanced Automation**: Combine multiple slash commands to create complex automated sequences

This opens up new possibilities for task automation, letting the AI leverage the full power of Roo Code's slash command ecosystem programmatically.

> **ðŸ“š Documentation**: See the [run_slash_command tool documentation](/advanced-usage/available-tools/run-slash-command) for usage examples and integration patterns.

## QOL Improvements

* **Settings Scroll Position**: Settings tabs now remember their individual scroll positions when switching between them (thanks DC-Dancao!) ([#7587](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7587))

## Bug Fixes

* **Tool Approval Fix**: Fixed an error that occurred when using insert_content and search_and_replace tools on write-protected files - these tools now handle file protection correctly ([#7649](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7649))

## Provider Updates

* **Kimi K2 Turbo Model**: Added support for the high-speed Kimi K2 Turbo model with 60-100 tokens/sec processing and a 131K token context window (thanks wangxiaolong100!) ([#7593](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7593))

## Image Editing with Input Images

We've enhanced the image generation tool with the ability to edit and transform existing images ([#7525](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7525)):

- **Transform Existing Images**: Apply artistic styles, convert photos to paintings, or create variations of existing artwork
- **Style Transfer**: Convert images into watercolor, oil painting, sketch, or other artistic styles
- **Image Enhancement**: Upscale and enhance existing images to higher resolution while maintaining composition
- **Creative Editing**: Use text prompts to modify specific aspects of an image while preserving the rest

The tool now accepts an optional `image` parameter for transforming existing images in your workspace. Supported input formats include PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, and WEBP.

> **ðŸ“š Documentation**: See [Image Generation - Editing Existing Images](/features/image-generation#editing-existing-images) for detailed usage and transformation examples.

## Bug Fixes

* **Image Generation Settings**: Fixed issue where the saved API key would clear when switching modes ([#7536](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7536))

## Misc Improvements

* **Test Debugging**: Console logs now visible in tests when using the --no-silent flag (thanks hassoncs!) ([#7467](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7467))

## Kimi K2-0905: Moonshot's Latest Open Source Model is Live in Roo Code

We've upgraded to the latest Kimi K2-0905 models across multiple providers (thanks CellenLee!) ([#7663](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7663), [#7693](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7693)):

K2-0905 comes with three major upgrades:
- **256K Context Window**: Massive context supporting up to 256K-262K tokens, doubling the previous limit for processing much larger documents and conversations
- **Improved Tool Calling**: Enhanced function calling and tool use capabilities for better agentic workflows
- **Enhanced Front-end Development**: Superior HTML, CSS, and JavaScript generation with modern framework support

Available through Groq, Moonshot, and Fireworks providers. These models excel at handling large codebases, long conversations, and complex multi-file operations.

## OpenAI Service Tiers

We've added support for OpenAI's new Responses API service tiers ([#7646](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7646)):

- **Standard Tier**: Default tier with regular pricing
- **Flex Tier**: 50% discount with slightly longer response times for non-urgent tasks
- **Priority Tier**: Faster response times for time-critical operations

Select your preferred tier directly in the UI based on your needs and budget. This gives you more control over costs while maintaining access to OpenAI's powerful models.

> **ðŸ“š Documentation**: See [OpenAI Provider Guide](/providers/openai) for detailed tier comparison and pricing.

## DeepInfra Provider

DeepInfra is now available as a model provider (thanks Thachnh!) ([#7677](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7677)):

- **100+ Models**: Access to a vast selection of open-source and frontier models
- **Competitive Pricing**: Very cost-effective rates compared to other providers
- **Automatic Prompt Caching**: Built-in prompt caching for supported models like Qwen3 Coder
- **Fast Inference**: Optimized infrastructure for quick response times

DeepInfra is an excellent choice for developers looking for variety and value in their AI model selection.

## QOL Improvements

* **Shell Security**: Added shell executable allowlist validation with platform-specific fallbacks for improved command execution safety ([#7681](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7681))

## Bug Fixes

* **MCP Tool Validation**: Roo now validates MCP tool existence before execution and shows helpful error messages with available tools (thanks R-omk!) ([#7632](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7632))
* **OpenAI API Key Errors**: Clear error messages now display when API keys contain invalid characters instead of cryptic ByteString errors (thanks A0nameless0man!) ([#7586](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7586))
* **Follow-up Questions**: Fixed countdown timer incorrectly reappearing in task history for already answered follow-up questions (thanks XuyiK!) ([#7686](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7686))
* **Moonshot Token Limit**: Resolved issue where Moonshot models were incorrectly limited to 1024 tokens, now properly respects configured limits (thanks wangxiaolong100, greyishsong!) ([#7673](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7673))
* **Zsh Command Safety**: Improved handling of zsh process substitution and glob qualifiers to prevent auto-execution of potentially dangerous commands ([#7658](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7658), [#7667](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7667))
* **Traditional Chinese Localization**: Fixed typo in zh-TW locale text (thanks PeterDaveHello!) ([#7672](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7672))

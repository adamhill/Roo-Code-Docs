## 1M context for Claude Sonnet 4.5 in Claude Code

We've added a 1Mâ€‘token context variant of Claude Sonnet 4.5 to Claude Code (thanks ColbySerpa!) ([#8586](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8586)):

- Fit very large projects and long logs with fewer truncations.
- Select it via the [1m] suffix when choosing the model; reduces splitting and manual chunking.

This makes it easier to work across big repos and lengthy traces without losing context.

> **ðŸ“š Documentation**: See [Claude Code provider](/providers/claude-code) for model options and context limits.

## QOL Improvements

* Identify Cloud tasks in the extension bridge to improve diagnostics, logging, and future UI behavior ([#8539](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8539))
* Add the parent task ID in telemetry to improve traceability ([#8532](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8532))

## Bug Fixes

* Make Ollama and LM Studio appear as dynamic providers in provider lists so they can be selected and configured like others ([#8511](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8511))

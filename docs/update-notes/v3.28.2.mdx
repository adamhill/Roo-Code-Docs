## QOL Improvements

* Smaller and more subtle auto-approve UI (thanks brunobergher!) ([#7894](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7894))
* Disable Roomote Control on logout for better security ([#7976](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7976))
* Add padding to the cloudview for better visual spacing ([#7954](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7954))

## Bug Fixes

* Fix message queue re-queue loop in Task.ask() that could degrade performance ([#7823](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7823))
* Restrict @-mention parsing to line-start or whitespace boundaries to prevent false triggers ([#7876](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7876))
* Make nested git repository warning persistent with path info for better visibility ([#7885](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7885))
* Include API key in Ollama /api/tags requests to support authenticated instances (thanks ItsOnlyBinary!) ([#7903](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7903))
* Preserve original first message context during conversation condensing for more coherent long chats ([#7939](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7939))

## Provider Updates

* Add Qwen3 Next 80B A3B models to the chutes provider ([#7948](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7948))

# Roo Code 3.18.3 Release Notes (2025-05-24)

This release introduces experimental codebase indexing with semantic search, enhanced AI reasoning capabilities, and several performance optimizations.

---

## Codebase Indexing (Experimental)
We've introduced a powerful new **experimental** [Codebase Indexing](/features/codebase-indexing) feature that enables semantic search across your entire project using AI embeddings. Remember, this is **disabled by default** and requires additional setup (enable in Settings (⚙️) > "Experimental").

Key capabilities:
*   **Semantic Code Search**: Find relevant code using natural language queries instead of exact keyword matches
*   **AI-Powered Understanding**: The new [`codebase_search`](/advanced-usage/available-tools/codebase-search) tool understands code meaning and relationships
*   **Cross-Project Discovery**: Search your entire indexed codebase, not just open files
*   **Flexible Setup**: Choose between OpenAI embeddings or local Ollama processing
*   **Vector-Powered Search**: Advanced embedding technology with Qdrant vector database storage

Transform how you navigate large codebases - ask "find authentication logic" and get meaningful results instead of hunting through files. (thanks daniel-lxs!)

For setup instructions and detailed usage, see the main [Codebase Indexing documentation](/features/codebase-indexing).

## Provider Updates

*   **Enhanced Reasoning**: Added reasoning support for Claude 4 and Gemini 2.5 Flash on [`OpenRouter`](/providers/openrouter), plus fixed o1-pro compatibility
*   **Improved Defaults**: Changed default model from Sonnet 3.7 to Sonnet 4 for better performance
*   **Prompt Caching**: Enabled prompt caching for Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview to reduce costs and improve response times (thanks shariqriazz!)
*   **OpenRouter Settings**: Model settings now persist when selecting specific [`OpenRouter`](/providers/openrouter) providers
*   **LiteLLM Refresh**: Added ability to refresh [`LiteLLM`](/providers/litellm) models list for up-to-date model availability

## QOL Improvements

*   **Better Tool Selection**: Improved tool descriptions to guide AI in making better file editing decisions

---

## Bug Fixes

*   **Context Tracking**: Fixed mark-as-read logic in the context tracker (thanks samhvw8!)
*   **Model Cleanup**: Removed deprecated claude-3.7-sonnet models from vscode-lm (thanks shariqriazz!)
*   **MCP Server Loading**: Fixed MCP Server error when running with npx and bunx (thanks devxpain!)

## Misc Improvements

*   **Build Process**: Improved pnpm bootstrapping and added compile script (thanks KJ7LNW!)
*   **Code Quality**: Simplified object assignment and modernized code patterns (thanks noritaka1166!)

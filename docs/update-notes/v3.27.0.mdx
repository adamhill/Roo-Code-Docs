## Edit and delete messages with instant rollback checkpoints

Edit or delete any chat message and quickly recover from mistakes using automatic checkpoints (thanks NaccOll!) ([#7447](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7447), [#7713](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7713)):

- Edit or delete past messages to correct prompts without restarting the session.
- Automatic checkpoint on every user message enables instant rollback, even when no file diffs exist.
- Review changes with a Checkpoint Restore dialog before applying them.
- Runs in the background and suppresses extra chat noise.

## QOL Improvements

* Welcome screen readability and spacing improvements for faster scanning (#[7682](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7682))

## Bug Fixes

* Fixes an issue where indexing very large projects could hit a stack overflow (thanks StarTrai1!) (#[7712](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7712))
* Fixes an issue where terminal launch sometimes failed when VS Code provided the shell path as an array (thanks Amosvcc!) (#[7697](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7697))
* Fixes cases where MCP and slash-command paths in multi-root workspaces resolved to the wrong folder (now uses the active folder CWD) (thanks NaccOll, kfuglsang!) (#[6904](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6904))
* Fixes an issue where Gemini grounding citations sometimes leaked or duplicated (thanks HahaBill!) (#[7434](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7434))
* Fixes an issue where conversation context could be lost when previous_response_id became invalid (now retries with full history) (#[7714](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7714))
* Fixes a CI issue where e2e runs sometimes timed out while downloading VS Code (#[7583](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7583))

## Provider Updates

* Chutes: Adds Kimi K2-0905 model with a 256k context window and pricing metadata (thanks pwilkin!) (#[7701](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7701))

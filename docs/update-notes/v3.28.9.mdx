## Supernova upgraded to 1M-token context

Supernova is now roo/code-supernova-1-million with a 1,000,000‚Äëtoken context window. Existing settings migrate automatically; no action needed:

- Work across very large files and long multi‚Äëstep conversations with far fewer truncations
- More stable execution on big refactors and long file read/write loops
- Auto‚Äëmigrate: previous roo/code-supernova maps to roo/code-supernova-1-million

Quick start: https://app.roocode.com/l/supernova

> **üìö Documentation**: See [Providers](/providers/) for model configuration details, and [Roo Code Cloud](/roo-code-cloud/what-is-roo-code-cloud) to use hosted models.

## QOL Improvements

* **Reset logs you out of Roo Code Cloud**: Reset now also logs you out of Roo Code Cloud for a truly clean slate; the reset still completes even if logout fails. ([#8312](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8312))
* **Measure engagement with upsell messages**: Telemetry for DismissibleUpsell tracks dismiss vs click (upsellId only) to tune messaging and reduce noise; no user-facing behavior change. ([#8309](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8309))
* **Discover Roo Code Cloud faster in the welcome screen**: Experiment to show the Roo provider on the welcome screen (localized strings with click telemetry) to speed up setup. ([#8317](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8317))
* **Cleaner prompts (no ‚Äúthinking‚Äù tags)**: Removes &lt;thinking&gt; tags for cleaner output, fewer tokens, and better model compatibility; preserves the plain‚Äëlanguage rule to confirm tool success. ([#8319](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8319))
* **Simpler Requesty model refresh**: Removes an unnecessary warning when refreshing the Requesty models list so you can fetch new policies without leaving the screen (thanks requesty-JohnCosta27!) ([#7710](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7710))

## Bug Fixes

* **Tool‚Äëuse guidance clarity**: Clarifies the retry suggestion so the model selects the correct file‚Äëreading step during apply‚Äëdiff retries, reducing failed file edits. ([#8315](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8315))

## Misc Improvements

* **Website improvements**: New pricing page, clearer homepage messaging, and tighter navigation/visuals (including mobile). No changes to the extension UX. ([#8303](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8303), [#8326](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8326))
* **Internal cleanup**: Removes the deprecated pr-reviewer mode. No changes to the extension UX. ([#8222](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8222))

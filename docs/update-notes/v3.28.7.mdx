## QOL Improvements

* Cloud account switcher: Easily change account context without leaving your current view ([#8223](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8223))
* Collapse thinking messages by default: Conversations are easier to scan; configurable via Settings â†’ UI ([#8254](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8254))

## Bug Fixes

* Checkpoint restore popover remains anchored and interactive when moving from the saved checkpoint indicator to the menu, preventing flicker/misalignment and accidental closing (thanks NaccOll!) ([#8220](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8220))

## Provider Updates

* Chutes: add `zai-org/GLM-4.5-turbo` model with a 128K context window and competitive pricing (approx. $1/M input, $3/M output), enabling longer prompts with fast inference (thanks mugnimaestra!) ([#8157](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8157))

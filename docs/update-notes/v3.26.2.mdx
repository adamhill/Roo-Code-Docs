## Image Generation (OpenRouter) — Free option: Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview

Generate images from natural‑language prompts directly inside Roo Code using OpenRouter’s image generation models. Configure your OpenRouter API key, pick a supported model, and preview results in the built‑in Image Viewer. See [Image Generation](/features/image-generation) and [OpenRouter Provider](/providers/openrouter) for setup and model selection.

- **Free option available: Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview** — try image generation without paid credits for faster onboarding and quick experiments
- Prompt‑to‑image workflow inside the editor with approvals flow (supports auto‑approval when write permissions are granted)
- Image Viewer with zoom, copy, and save for quick reuse in docs and prototypes

## GPT-5 usage without BYOK rate limit blockers

If you’re being rate limited with GPT‑5, you can now use GPT‑5 models without bringing your own key. This improves availability and reduces interruptions during development. See [OpenAI Provider](/providers/openai) for model support and guidance.


## QOL Improvements

- Improved padding and click targets in the image model picker for easier selection and fewer misclicks. (#[7494](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7494))
- Generic default filename for saved images (e.g., `img_<timestamp>`) instead of `mermaid_diagram_<timestamp>`. (#[7479](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7479))

## Bug Fixes

- ImageGenerationSettings no longer shows a dirty state on first open; the save button only enables after an actual change. (#[7495](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7495))
- GPT‑5 reliability improvements:
  - Manual condense preserves conversation continuity by correctly handling `previous_response_id` on the next request
  - Image inputs work reliably with structured text+image payloads
  - Temperature control is shown only for models that support it
  - Fewer GPT‑5–specific errors with updated provider definitions and SDK (thanks nlbuescher!)

## Misc Improvements

- Release automation: version bumps, changelog updates, and auto-publishing on merge for a faster, more reliable release process. (#[7490](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7490))
- New TaskSpawned developer event so integrations can detect when a subtask is created and capture its ID for chaining or monitoring. (#[7465](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7465))
- Roo Code Cloud SDK bumped to 0.25.0. (#[7475](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7475))

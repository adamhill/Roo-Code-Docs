# Roo Code 3.26 Release Notes

This document combines all releases in the v3.26 series.

<img src="/img/v3.26.0/v3.26.0.png" alt="Roo Code v3.26 Release" width="600" />
### Grok Code Fast

As you may have already figured out, our stealth model Sonic has officially been uncloaked! ([#7426](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7426))

From xAI, this model is optimized for coding tasks and already beloved by the community in Code Mode for its:
- **Sharp reasoning** capabilities
- **Plan execution at scale**
- **Code suggestions with UI taste and intuition**

If you've already been enjoying Sonic in Roo Code Cloud, you'll be transitioned to Grok Code Fast. The model `xai/grok-code-fast-1` is also available under the [xAI Provider](/providers/xai) and is not free (for when the free period ends on Aug 28th, 2025).

A massive thank-you to our partners at xAI and to all of you â€” over 100B tokens (and counting!) ran through Sonic during stealth! Your incredible adoption and helpful feedback shaped Grok Code Fast into the powerful model it is today.

**Important:** Grok Code Fast remains **FREE** when accessed through the [Roo Code Cloud provider](/providers/roo-code-cloud) during the promotional period. Using it directly through the xAI provider will incur standard charges once pricing is established.

> **ðŸ“š Documentation**: See [Roo Code Cloud Provider](/providers/roo-code-cloud) for free access or [xAI Provider](/providers/xai) for direct configuration.

### Built-in /init Command

We've added a new /init slash command for project onboarding ([#7381](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7381), [#7400](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7400)):

- **Automatic Project Analysis**: Analyzes your entire codebase and creates comprehensive AGENTS.md files
- **AI Assistant Optimization**: Generates documentation that enables AI assistants to be immediately productive in your codebase
- **Mode-Specific Guidance**: Creates tailored documentation for different Roo Code modes (code, debug, architect, etc.)

The /init command helps LLMs understand your project's unique patterns and conventions by documenting project-specific information that isn't obvious from the code structure alone.

> ðŸ“š Documentation: See [Slash Commands - The init command](/features/slash-commands#the-init-command) for details.

### New run_slash_command Tool

We've added a powerful new tool that allows the AI to execute slash commands as part of its workflow ([#7473](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7473)):

- **Automated Command Execution**: The AI can now run commands like `/init`, `/review`, and other slash commands automatically
- **Seamless Integration**: Existing slash commands work directly within AI workflows without manual intervention
- **Enhanced Automation**: Combine multiple slash commands to create complex automated sequences

This opens up new possibilities for task automation, letting the AI leverage the full power of Roo Code's slash command ecosystem programmatically.

> **ðŸ“š Documentation**: See the [run_slash_command tool documentation](/advanced-usage/available-tools/run-slash-command) for usage examples and integration patterns.

### Qwen Code CLI API Support

We've integrated with the Qwen Code CLI tool, allowing Roo Code to leverage its free access tier for Alibaba's Qwen3 Coder models ([#7380](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7380)):

- **Free Inference**: Piggybacks off the Qwen Code CLI's generous free tier (2,000 requests/day and 60 requests/minute with no token limits) via OAuth, available during a promotional period.
- **1M Context Windows**: Handle entire codebases in a single conversation.
- **Seamless Setup**: Works automatically if you've already authenticated the Qwen Code CLI tool.

This integration provides free access to the Qwen3 Coder models by using the local authentication from the Qwen Code CLI.

> **ðŸ“š Documentation**: See [Qwen Code CLI Provider](/providers/qwen-code) for setup and configuration.

### Vercel AI Gateway Provider

We've added Vercel AI Gateway as a complete provider integration (thanks joshualipman123!) ([#7396](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7396), [#7433](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7433)):

- **Full Provider Support**: Use Vercel AI Gateway as a comprehensive AI model provider alongside existing options
- **Model Access**: Access Vercel's wide range of AI models through their optimized gateway infrastructure
- **Embeddings Support**: Includes built-in support for Vercel AI Gateway embeddings ([#7445](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7445))

> **ðŸ“š Documentation**: See [Vercel AI Gateway](/providers/vercel-ai-gateway) for detailed setup instructions.

### Image Generation (OpenRouter) â€” Free option: Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview

Generate images from naturalâ€‘language prompts directly inside Roo Code using OpenRouter's image generation models. Configure your OpenRouter API key, pick a supported model, and preview results in the builtâ€‘in Image Viewer. See [Image Generation](/features/image-generation) and [OpenRouter Provider](/providers/openrouter) for setup and model selection.

- **Free option available: Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview** â€” try image generation without paid credits for faster onboarding and quick experiments
- Promptâ€‘toâ€‘image workflow inside the editor with approvals flow (supports autoâ€‘approval when write permissions are granted)
- Image Viewer with zoom, copy, and save for quick reuse in docs and prototypes
- **NEW in v3.26.3: Image Editing** â€” Transform and edit existing images in your workspace ([#7525](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7525)):
  - Apply artistic styles like watercolor, oil painting, or sketch
  - Upscale and enhance images to higher resolution
  - Modify specific aspects while preserving the rest
  - Supports PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, and WEBP input formats

PRs: [#7474](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7474), [#7492](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7492), [#7493](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7493), [#7525](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7525))

> **ðŸ“š Documentation**: See [Image Generation - Editing Existing Images](/features/image-generation#editing-existing-images) for transformation examples.

### Kimi K2-0905: Moonshot's Latest Open Source Model is Live in Roo Code

We've upgraded to the latest Kimi K2-0905 models across multiple providers (thanks CellenLee!) ([#7663](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7663), [#7693](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7693)):

K2-0905 comes with three major upgrades:
- **256K Context Window**: Massive context supporting up to 256K-262K tokens, doubling the previous limit for processing much larger documents and conversations
- **Improved Tool Calling**: Enhanced function calling and tool use capabilities for better agentic workflows
- **Enhanced Front-end Development**: Superior HTML, CSS, and JavaScript generation with modern framework support

Available through Groq, Moonshot, and Fireworks providers. These models excel at handling large codebases, long conversations, and complex multi-file operations.

### OpenAI Service Tiers

We've added support for OpenAI's new Responses API service tiers ([#7646](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7646)):

- **Standard Tier**: Default tier with regular pricing
- **Flex Tier**: 50% discount with slightly longer response times for non-urgent tasks
- **Priority Tier**: Faster response times for time-critical operations

Select your preferred tier directly in the UI based on your needs and budget. This gives you more control over costs while maintaining access to OpenAI's powerful models.

> **ðŸ“š Documentation**: See [OpenAI Provider Guide](/providers/openai) for detailed tier comparison and pricing.

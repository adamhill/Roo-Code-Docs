# Auto-Approving Actions

> ⚠️ **SECURITY WARNING:** Auto-approve settings bypass confirmation prompts, giving Roo direct access to your system. This can result in **data loss, file corruption, or worse**. Command line access is particularly dangerous, as it can potentially execute harmful operations that could damage your system or compromise security. Only enable auto-approval for actions you fully trust.

Auto-approve settings speed up your workflow by eliminating repetitive confirmation prompts, but they significantly increase security risks.

## Quick Start Guide

1. Open the Auto-Approve dropdown next to the chat input
2. Toggle "Enabled" at the bottom-right of the dropdown to activate or pause auto-approval
3. Use the All/None chips to bulk-select or clear permissions, or select individual tiles; you can keep Enabled On with "None" selected
4. (Optional) Click the gear icon to open Settings for deeper per-permission controls

### Keyboard Shortcut

**Default shortcut:** `Cmd+Alt+A` (macOS) / `Ctrl+Alt+A` (Windows/Linux)

Quickly toggle auto-approve on/off without using the mouse. This shortcut toggles the global "Enabled" state while preserving your permission selections.

**To customize the shortcut:**
1. Open VS Code Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Search for "Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts"
3. Search for the command name (varies by language):
   - English: "Toggle Auto-Approve"
   - Other languages: Look for the localized equivalent
4. Click the pencil icon next to the command
5. Press your desired key combination
6. Press Enter to save

**Note:** The command name appears in your VS Code interface language. If you're using a non-English locale, the command will be translated accordingly.

## Auto-Approve Dropdown

<img src="/img/auto-approving-actions/auto-approving-actions-20.png" alt="Auto-Approve dropdown with All/None chips and global Enabled toggle (bottom-right)" width="600" />

The dropdown shows a grid of permission tiles. Controls:
- Enabled (bottom-right): master pause/resume for auto-approval
- All / None (bottom-left): bulk select or clear permissions without changing Enabled
- Permission tiles: choose which actions can run without prompts; some tiles may be disabled depending on model or mode


### Available Permissions

| Permission | What it does | Risk level |
|------------|--------------|------------|
| **Read files and directories** | Lets Roo access files without asking | Medium |
| **Edit files** | Lets Roo modify files without asking | **High** |
| **Execute approved commands** | Runs whitelisted terminal commands automatically | **High** |
| **Use the browser** | Allows headless browser interaction | Medium |
| **Use MCP servers** | Lets Roo use configured MCP services | Medium-High |
| **Switch modes** | Changes between Roo modes automatically | Low |
| **Create & complete subtasks** | Manages subtasks without confirmation | Low |
| **Retry failed requests** | Automatically retries failed API requests | Low |
| **Answer follow-up questions** | Selects default answer for follow-up questions| Low |
| **Update todo list** | Automatically updates task progress | Low |

## Global Enabled Switch

<img src="/img/auto-approving-actions/auto-approving-actions-21.png" alt="Auto-Approve dropdown; Enabled at bottom-right and All/None chips at bottom-left" width="600" />

How it works:
- Enabled On — Auto-approval runs for the permissions you’ve selected
- Enabled Off — Pauses all auto-approvals; your per-permission selections persist
- All / None — Bulk adjust selections while Enabled remains unchanged

When to toggle:
- Sensitive or production work → Off
- Rapid iteration and refactors → On
- Switching between exploration and editing tasks

---

## Advanced Settings Panel

The settings panel provides detailed control with important security context:

> **Allow Roo to automatically perform operations without requiring approval. Enable these settings only if you fully trust the AI and understand the associated security risks.**

To access these settings:

1. Click <Codicon name="gear" /> in the top-right of the dropdown
2. Navigate to Auto-Approve Settings

The settings panel mirrors the same permissions with additional context and safeguards.

### Read Operations

:::info Read Operations (Risk: Medium)

<img src="/img/auto-approving-actions/auto-approving-actions-3.png" alt="Read-only operations setting" width="550" />

**Setting:** "Always approve read-only operations"

**Description:** "When enabled, Roo will automatically view directory contents and read files without requiring you to click the Approve button."

**Additional option:**
- **Include files outside workspace:** Allow Roo to read files outside the current workspace directory

**Risk level:** Medium

While this setting only allows reading files (not modifying them), it could potentially expose sensitive data. Still recommended as a starting point for most users, but be mindful of what files Roo can access.

#### Workspace Boundary Protection

By default, Roo can only read files within your current workspace directory. The "Include files outside workspace" option extends read access beyond the workspace boundary. Consider the security implications:

- **Default (unchecked)**: Roo can only read files in your project directory
- **Enabled**: Roo can read any file on your system that you have access to
- **Recommendation**: Keep disabled unless you specifically need Roo to access external files
:::

### Write Operations

:::caution Write Operations (Risk: High)
<img src="/img/auto-approving-actions/auto-approving-actions-16.png" alt="Write operations setting with delay slider" width="550" />

**Setting:** "Always approve write operations"

**Description:** "Automatically create and edit files without requiring approval"

**Delay slider:** "Delay after writes to allow diagnostics to detect potential problems" (Default: 1000ms / 1 second)

**Additional options:**
- **Include files outside workspace:** Allow Roo to modify files outside the current workspace directory
- **Include protected files:** Allow Roo to modify files normally protected by .rooignore and .roo/ directory

**Risk level:** High

This setting allows Roo to modify your files without confirmation. The delay timer is crucial:
- Higher values (2000ms+): Recommended for complex projects where diagnostics take longer
- Default (1000ms): Suitable for most projects with active diagnostics
- 0ms: No delay - use when speed is critical
- Lower values: Use only when in a controlled environment

#### Security Boundaries

The write operations setting includes two important security controls:

1. **Workspace Boundary Protection**: By default, Roo can only modify files within your current workspace. Enable "Include files outside workspace" with extreme caution.

2. **Protected Files**: Roo has built-in protection for sensitive configuration files to prevent accidental modifications. This includes:
   - Files in the `.roo/` directory
   - Files listed in `.rooignore`
   - Roo's own configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc. when they contain Roo-specific settings)
   
   The "Include protected files" option bypasses this protection - use only when you specifically need to modify these protected files.

#### Write Delay & Problems Pane Integration

<img src="/img/auto-approving-actions/auto-approving-actions-5.png" alt="VSCode Problems pane showing diagnostic information" width="600" />

*VSCode Problems pane that Roo checks during the write delay*

When you enable auto-approval for writing files, the delay timer works with VSCode's Problems pane:

1. Roo makes a change to your file
2. VSCode's diagnostic tools analyze the change
3. The Problems pane updates with any errors or warnings
4. Roo notices these issues before continuing

This works like a human developer pausing to check for errors after changing code. You can adjust the delay time based on:

- Project complexity
- Language server speed
- How important error detection is for your workflow
:::

### Browser Actions

:::info Browser Actions (Risk: Medium)

**Setting:** "Always approve browser actions"

**Description:** "Automatically perform browser actions without requiring approval"

**Note:** "Only applies when the model supports computer use"

**Risk level:** Medium

Allows Roo to control a headless browser without confirmation. This can include:
- Opening websites
- Navigating pages
- Interacting with web elements

Consider the security implications of allowing automated browser access.
:::

### API Requests

:::info API Requests (Risk: Low)
<img src="/img/auto-approving-actions/auto-approving-actions-17.png" alt="API requests retry setting with delay slider" width="550" />

**Setting:** "Always retry failed API requests"

**Description:** "Automatically retry failed API requests when server returns an error response"

**Delay slider:** "Delay before retrying the request" (Default: 10 seconds)

**Risk level:** Low

This setting automatically retries API calls when they fail. The retry mechanism uses exponential backoff:
- **Initial delay**: Set by the slider (default: 10 seconds)
- **Backoff formula**: `min(baseDelay * 2^retryAttempt, 600)`
- **Maximum delay**: 600 seconds (10 minutes)

Example retry sequence with 10s base delay:
- 1st retry: 10 seconds
- 2nd retry: 20 seconds
- 3rd retry: 40 seconds
- 4th retry: 80 seconds
- 5th retry: 160 seconds
- 6th retry: 320 seconds
- 7th+ retry: 600 seconds (capped)

This exponential backoff helps prevent overwhelming APIs while still recovering from transient errors.
:::

### MCP Tools

:::caution MCP Tools (Risk: Medium-High)

**Setting:** "Always approve MCP tools"

**Description:** "Enable auto-approval of individual MCP tools in the MCP Servers view (requires both this setting and the tool's individual 'Always allow' checkbox)"

**Risk level:** Medium-High (depends on configured MCP tools)

This setting requires a two-step permission process for security:

1. **Enable this global setting** - Acts as a master switch for all MCP tool auto-approval
2. **Enable individual tool permissions** - In the MCP Servers view, check "Always allow" for specific tools

**Important:** Both permissions must be active for a tool to auto-approve. This dual-permission system ensures you maintain granular control over which MCP tools can execute without confirmation.

**Permission Storage:** Your MCP tool permissions are saved and will be remembered next time you use Roo Code.

Example workflow:
- Enable "Always approve MCP tools" in settings
- Navigate to MCP Servers view
- Find the specific tool (e.g., filesystem operations)
- Check its "Always allow" checkbox
- Only then will that specific tool auto-approve
:::

### Mode Switching

:::info Mode Switching (Risk: Low)

**Setting:** "Always approve mode switching"

**Description:** "Automatically switch between different modes without requiring approval"

**Risk level:** Low

Allows Roo to change between different modes (Code, Architect, etc.) without asking for permission. This primarily affects the AI's behavior rather than system access.
:::

### Subtasks

:::info Subtasks (Risk: Low)

**Setting:** "Always approve creation & completion of subtasks"

**Description:** "Allow creation and completion of subtasks without requiring approval"

**Risk level:** Low

Enables Roo to create and complete subtasks automatically. This relates to workflow organization rather than system access.
:::

### Command Execution

:::caution Command Execution (Risk: High)
<img src="/img/auto-approving-actions/auto-approving-actions-18.png" alt="Command execution setting with whitelist interface" width="550" />

**Setting:** "Always approve allowed execute operations"

**Description:** "Automatically execute allowed terminal commands without requiring approval"

**Command management:** "Command prefixes that can be auto-executed when 'Always approve execute operations' is enabled. Add * to allow all commands (use with caution)."

**Risk level:** High

This setting allows terminal command execution with controls. While risky, the whitelist feature limits what commands can run. Important security features:

- Whitelist specific command prefixes (recommended)
- Never use * wildcard in production or with sensitive data
- Consider security implications of each allowed command
- Always verify commands that interact with external systems

**Interface elements:**
- Text field to enter command prefixes
- "Add" button to add new prefixes
- Clickable command buttons with X to remove them

**Common whitelist examples:**
- `git` - Version control operations
- `npm run` - Run package.json scripts
- `python -m pytest` - Run Python tests
- `cargo test` - Run Rust tests
- `go test` - Run Go tests
- `docker ps` - List Docker containers
- `ls` - List directory contents
- `cat` - Display file contents

**Security tip:** Be specific with prefixes. Instead of allowing all `python` commands, limit to `python -m pytest` for test execution only.

### Follow-Up Questions

:::info Follow-Up Questions (Risk: Low)
<img src="/img/auto-approving-actions/auto-approving-actions-15.png" alt="Follow-up question operations setting with timeout slider" width="550" />

**Setting:** `Always default answer for follow-up questions`

**Description:** Automatically selects the first AI-suggested answer for a follow-up question after a configurable timeout. This speeds up your workflow by letting Roo proceed without manual intervention.

**Visual countdown:** When enabled, a countdown timer appears on the first suggestion button, showing the remaining time before auto-selection. The timer is displayed as a circular progress indicator that depletes as time passes.

**Timeout slider:** Use the slider to set the wait time from 1 to 300 seconds (Default: 60 seconds)

**How it works:**
- The countdown starts at your configured time (default: 60 seconds)
- When the timer reaches zero, the first suggestion is automatically selected
- You can pause the countdown by clicking on the timer

**Override options:** You can cancel the auto-selection at any time by:
- Clicking a different suggestion
- Editing any suggestion
- Typing your own response
- Clicking the timer to pause it

**Risk level:** Low

**Use cases:**
- Overnight runs where you want Roo to continue working
- Repetitive tasks where the default suggestions are usually correct
- Testing workflows where interaction isn't critical
:::

### Update Todo List

:::info Update Todo List (Risk: Low)

**Setting:** "Always approve todo list updates"

**Description:** "Automatically update the to-do list without requiring approval"

**Risk level:** Low

This setting allows Roo to automatically update task progress and todo lists during work sessions. This includes:
- Marking tasks as completed
- Adding new discovered tasks
- Updating task status (pending, in progress, completed)
- Reorganizing task priorities

**Benefits:**
- Maintains real-time task progress visibility
- Reduces interruptions during multi-step workflows
- Keeps project status accurately reflected
- Helps track complex task dependencies

**Use cases:**
- Long-running development sessions
- Multi-step refactoring projects
- Complex debugging workflows
- Feature implementation with many subtasks

This is particularly useful when combined with the Subtasks permission, as it allows Roo to maintain a complete picture of project progress without constant approval requests.
